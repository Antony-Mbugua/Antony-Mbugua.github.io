# About Me

I’m Antony Mbugua Githinji, an Applied Computing graduate specializing in Information Security and Forensics.  
My work focuses on building reliable systems and applying practical security controls that strengthen how organizations handle data, access, and operations.

I approach cybersecurity from a hands-on perspective — understanding how systems are built, where weaknesses normally appear, and how security can be integrated without disrupting usability. I value accuracy, clear documentation, and solutions that can be maintained over time.

## What I Work On
- Security monitoring, logging, and incident analysis  
- Authentication workflows and access control  
- System hardening and configuration security  
- Application development using React, Laravel, and Node.js  
- Database and API design with MySQL

## Goals
I’m continually improving my skills in cloud security, network defense, and threat analysis. My long-term focus is to work in environments that value secure engineering, measurable impact, and continuous learning.
